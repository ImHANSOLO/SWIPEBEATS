Vue 3 + Vite

This is a music player app built with Vue, using Tailwind CSS for styling, and Vite for the build process. It features a swipeable deck of playing cards. As for the audio source, it uses pre-selected tracks from the public folder, but will transfer to a Spotify API(or QQ music/NetEase music) call in the future.
